**OVERALL**

The game concept is play with a character chosen by the temple’s spirits to protect the ancient ruins and its relics from a coming menace. In the game the player control that character from a First Person perspective.
In this prototype, the player can play a demo version in which he can explore an introductory temple level, experimenting the key mechanics, to test and, therefore, validate several design aspects of it, such as puzzles, obstacles, UI and art (lights, atmosphere and aesthetics).
In this version of the game we currently have water, fire and air. With each element, the player can either absorb or cast the element from a mystical glove gun, activating or deactivating several triggerable objects to solve the puzzles. 

**ACTIVITIES AS LEAD/TECHNICAL ARTIST**

My role consisted in managing both aesthetical and design criteria for the game, being responsible of the look and feel of it, and constantly working next to Matthew and Robert in the blueprint specifications, application and edition among the project. 
In the first part I actively participated in the briefing process (game concept, scope and level design criteria definition) with the rest of the team, documenting all process and sketching several ideas for the game (traps, props, mechanics, etc) 
During the pre-production stage, I modelled the dungeon kit used to prototype the level and created initial Blueprints for it.  

In the production stage, I designed and modelled the final meshes for the game, and built the complete version of the temple level. In parallel, I supervised my artist colleagues work, giving them orientation to their respective activities (texture work and 3d modelling assistance).  

Additionally, I counted with the knowledge and assistance of Matthew to work in the redesign of many puzzles and aspect of the level design. Similarly, I worked with Robert designing and applying several sounds FX for the game.  

Through the process, I worked very close with Matthew and Robert, who helped me to resolve blueprints and logic issues, while I gave them design inputs to develop their BP as well. Similarly, as lead artist, I kept the project’s files in order and tracked progress of several check list of activities we made between several project’s phases.  

Finally, as part of my documentation activities, I worked with Matthew in the video and presentation production.
